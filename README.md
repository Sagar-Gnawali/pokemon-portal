# Getting Started with Pokemon Portal

This project utilizes the publicly available Pokemon API, which can be accessed at [https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/).

In this project, I've created some reusable components/functions for fuzzy searching, displaying the fallback page, and created complete SCSS/SASS classes without relying on any third-party libraries for styling.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` or `yarn install`

Installed all the dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
